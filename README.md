# Arduino-Workshop-ICL-2017

Welcome to the 2017 Arduino workshop at Imperial College. 
It's the 4th time I'm running an Arduino workshop in collaboration with Imperial College Design Collective. 
The aim of this workshop is to introduce the Arduino family and its development environment to students and staff at Imperial. 
The two-days workshop will combine presentations and hands-on sessions that will help you to start building your Arduino projects. 

This repository holds the presentation I'll ne giving and Arduino files that are the soliutions for your hand-on practice. 

Please look at the WS website for more details and: http://avi-braun.wixsite.com/arduino 
For questions (or if you want to arrange an Arduino workshop of your own in London), please cotnact me at a.braun@imperial.ac.uk
